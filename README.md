# IDEAS
List of ideas for projects I would like to make

ToDo list
  - Incorporate Create/Edit/Delete
  - Each item can have its own custom pomodoro
  - Rewards can be added randomly from a reward list/selected specifically for the item/Added just for that item
  - All time on ToDo is tracked and reported daily/weekly/annually/upon completion

The Duke - Two player chess like game
  - Create Board
  - Create pieces
  - Create shuffle method
  - using JS to move pieces as per rules

digiDucky
  - Create a Digital Open Source Rubber Ducky that listens responds to user when they talk to them with some basic responses
  - Kind of like a magic 8 ball (Oh I see... Can you explain that again? I can sympothize. That is not very fun. Have you read the documentation yet? When in doubt, log it out.)
